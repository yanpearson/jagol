*Just Another Game Of Life*

Jagol is a little project to help me to learn functional programming. It's not
the most clever implementation you will see but I hope this code will evolve as
my knowledge will go deeper on this topic.

# Instructions

- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Start the client: `npm start` (default address is localhost:8080)
- Run the tests: `npm test`
